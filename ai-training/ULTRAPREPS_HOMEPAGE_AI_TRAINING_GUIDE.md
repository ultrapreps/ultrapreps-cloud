const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => setIsMounted(true), []);
```

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Deterministic animations** to prevent hydration issues
- **Efficient re-renders** with proper React patterns
- **Optimized image loading** with Next.js Image component
- **CSS keyframes** for complex animations instead of JS

### Build Error Resolutions:
- **Escaped special characters** in JSX content
- **Removed unused imports** to clean warnings
- **Fixed syntax errors** with careful character checking
- **PowerShell compatibility** for Windows deployment
