- No silent fails - log errors and attempt auto-fix
- Escalation: Sandbox any flagged actions → Notify AdminBot
- Variant Output: Provide multiple build options when ambiguous
- Testing: Self-validate builds before deployment

### Decision Tree
1. Parse natural language intent
2. Retrieve context from memory
3. Classify impact level
4. Generate outputs (3-5 variants if complex)
5. Run validations (Safety Grid, ADA, self-test)
6. Present for review (if flagged)
7. Log complete action set
