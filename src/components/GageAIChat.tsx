  // SPORTS KNOWLEDGE (Football)
  football_strategy: [
    "Football IQ is everything! Study film like Tom Brady - 3 hours of film for every 1 hour of practice. Break down opposing defenses and learn to read coverage pre-snap!",
    "Want to dominate at QB? Master the pocket presence first. Practice your footwork daily - 3-step, 5-step, 7-step drops until they're muscle memory!",
    "Running backs: Vision beats speed every time. Study how Saquon Barkley sets up his cuts. Plant and go - no dancing in the backfield!",
    "Defense wins championships! Study Ray Lewis' film - see how he reads the offense's keys and communicates. Leadership on defense is game-changing!",
    "O-line dominance starts with footwork. Master your kick-step, punch technique, and hand placement. Protect your QB like your life depends on it!"
  ],

  basketball_strategy: [
    "Basketball is a game of inches and IQ! Study Kobe's footwork - the jab step, pivot moves, and shot mechanics. Fundamentals separate good from great!",
    "Want to be unstoppable? Master the triple threat position. Catch, square up, read the defense - then attack! Kobe spent hours perfecting this!",
    "Defense creates offense! Study Kawhi Leonard's hand positioning and anticipation. Active hands, quick feet, and force players into tough shots!",
    "Point guards: Court vision is everything! Study how CP3 controls tempo. Always keep your head up and see the floor two passes ahead!",
    "Shooters are made, not born! Steph Curry shoots 500 shots daily. Perfect your form - balance, follow-through, and arc are everything!"
  ],

  baseball_strategy: [
    "Baseball is a mental game! Study pitch sequences like Mookie Betts. Learn to read pitchers' tells and count tendencies. Every at-bat is a chess match!",
    "Pitching dominance starts with command, not velocity! Study Greg Maddux - location beats gas every time. Paint the corners and change eye levels!",
    "Hit for average AND power! Study Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s approach - short stride, quiet hands, and attack strikes early in counts!",
    "Defense saves games! Study Andrelton Simmons' footwork and glove work. Every play matters - make the routine plays look easy!",
    "Catchers are field generals! Study how Yadier Molina calls games. Know every pitcher's strengths and weaknesses inside out!"

    "Create your brand! Be known for something special - work ethic, clutch performances, leadership. Make yourself unforgettable!"

  scholarship_advice: [
    "Academic scholarships often have less competition than athletic ones! Maintain a 3.7+ GPA and score 1300+ on SAT for serious money!",
    "Apply to 15-20 schools minimum! Cast a wide net - you only need ONE yes! Don't limit yourself geographically!",
    "FAFSA is your friend! Fill it out even if your family makes good money. You might qualify for grants you didn't expect!",
    "Smaller schools often offer MORE money! Division II and III schools can provide better financial packages than Division I!",
    "Merit scholarships stack! Academic + athletic + need-based can cover 100% of costs. Layer your opportunities!",
    "Apply early! Many scholarships are first-come, first-served. Don't wait until senior year - start junior year!"
