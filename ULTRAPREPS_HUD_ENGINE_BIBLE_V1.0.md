# ULTRAPREPS_HUD_ENGINE_BIBLE_V1.0

**Purpose:**  
To define the **HUD (Heads-Up Display) Engine** that turns HeroCards and posters into **interactive, real-time data hubs**, powering recruiting, family engagement, and HYPE growth.

---

## I. SYSTEM GOALS
1. **Live Data Experience:**  
   - HUD overlays update in **real-time** (stats, HYPE, achievements).  
2. **Role-Specific Views:**  
   - Different HUD modes for students, parents, recruiters, and coaches.  
3. **Seamless Poster Integration:**  
   - Every static HeroCard/poster is an **interactive gateway** to the athlete’s live profile.  
4. **Monetization & Engagement:**  
   - Boost HYPE, share achievements, and trigger NIL/booster actions directly from the HUD.

## II. DATA MODEL

### **HUDData JSON**
```json
{
  "hype_score": 86,
  "recent_stats": {
    "football": {"yards": 998, "receptions": 48, "tds": 12},
    "track": {"100m": "11.2s"}
  },
  "achievements": ["All-District 1st Team", "State Champion"],
  "highlight_reels": [
    {"title": "2024 Season Highlights", "url": "https://cdn.ultrapreps.com/highlights/kolebecker2024.mp4"}
  ],
  "academics": {
    "gpa": 3.7,
    "honors": ["NHS", "Honor Roll"]
  },
  "recruiting": {
    "contact": {"coach_email": "coach@school.edu"},
    "test_scores": {"sat": 1300, "act": 28}
  },
  "share_actions": {
    "share_url": "https://ultrapreps.com/athlete/kolebecker",

}
```

---

## IV. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### **Backend**
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /hud/:athleteId` → Returns HUDData JSON.
  - `POST /hud/:athleteId/boost` → Boost HYPE.
  - `POST /hud/:athleteId/share` → Track shares.

- **Realtime Layer:**  
  - **WebSockets** for HYPE updates & new stat pushes.

### **Frontend**
- **React Component:** `<HeroCardHUD profile={data} />`.
- **Poster Integration:**  
  - Posters embed QR code → opens live HUD view in-app/web.

---

## V. POSTER → HUD INTEGRATION

1. Every poster/HeroCard contains a **QR code or NFC tag**.  
2. Scanning opens a **live HUD microsite**:  
   - Always up-to-date (stats, HYPE).  
   - Role-based view auto-detected based on permissions.  

---

## VI. SCALING STRATEGY
- **Delta Updates:** Only update changed data points (not full payloads).  
- **Caching:** Short-term caching of HUD payloads for read-heavy endpoints.  
- **Batch Updates:** Team-level stat imports for multiple athletes at once.

---

## VII. IMPLEMENTATION TASKS (CLAUDE-READY)

### **Task 1:**  
Create `/api/hud/:athleteId` endpoint returning HUDData JSON.

### **Task 2:**  
Build WebSocket service for pushing HYPE/achievement updates in real-time.

### **Task 3:**  
Design `<HeroCardHUD />` React component with role-based conditional rendering.

### **Task 4:**  
Embed QR codes into all generated posters linking to live HUD views.

### **Task 5:**  
Implement sharing/boosting endpoints to gamify HUD interactions.

---

## VIII. DIFFERENTIATORS
- **Live recruiting cards:** Posters aren’t static—they’re **living digital resumes**.  
- **HYPE-driven engagement:** Fans, parents, and boosters can boost athletes instantly.  
- **Scalable, role-aware UX:** Students, recruiters, and families each see **customized data views**.

**This HUD engine transforms static HeroCards into interactive, real-time engagement tools — bridging recruiting, community pride, and gamified growth.**
